  # Raknet Specific Settings
  # If this is not provided the default settings will be used:

  #   max_channels: 1
  #   max_connections: 100

    # This specifications follows RakNet protocol 9+ (MCPE)
    # Whether or not to use secure connections

  # The port to listen on for IPv4 connections

  # Allowed Values: 0-65535

    # Allowed Values: 0-65535
    threshold: 256
    # The level of compression to use
    # Determines how small the packets will be when sent to the client.
    # If the value is too large the tradeoff will be slow decompress timings,
    # but smaller packets, which will increase latency.
    #
    # General rule of thumb:
    # Smaller = faster, but more bandwidth.
    # Larger = slower, but less bandwidth.
