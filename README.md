## Why Netrex?

 - It's written in Rust.
 - Unique and straight to the point.
 - Typescript Plugin API
 - Single Executable.
 - Open Source.

## The Game Plan

We have a plan for the initial release! View it on our [projects page](https://github.com/NetrexMC/Netrex/projects/1)!

## Scripts
All scripts can be accessed and viewed through the terminal by running `deno run -A ./scripts/mod.ts` in the home directory, or by installing them with deno. In this case, the name will be "nsc".

### Install Netrex Scripts

```bash
deno install -A -f -n nsc https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetrexMC/Netrex/master/scripts/mod.ts
```
