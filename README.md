          <h1> Netrex </h1>
          <p>A powerful minecraft bedrock software written in Typescript with Deno.</p>

### Why Netrex?
 - It's written in Typescript, and we are working on a closed rust fork with the same api so Netrex will be fast!
 - Unique and straight to the point.
 - Single Executable thanks to Deno.
 - Open Source

### The Game Plan

We have a plan for the initial release! View it on our [projects page](https://github.com/NetrexMC/Netrex-den/projects/1)!
